This github public repo summarizes the technical approach to **combine** several <a href="#NewComponents">new</a>
and existing "totally free" **open-source software** 
repos to measure the speed and load capacity risks of high-traffic web and native mobile apps.

   "Totally free" is in quotes because the spirit of free software is that the community which uses them contributes back.
So if you see a typo that needs fixing or an idea that should be considered, please fork this repo,
edit the file, and send us a pull request. Better yet, 
<a href="#NewComponents">join us</a> to revolutionalize the industry.

<a name="Background">
## Background Why</a>
The approach described here was created in response to the need for the fastest possible way to achieve load testing:

A. **Testing earlier** in the dev. lifecycle through more automatic **generation** of test automation scripts.

   Although various attempts at generating UI code have not taken hold due to complexity,
   generation of APIs is less complex of an undertaking.

B. **Automatic alerts** of slow execution speeds during automated functional testing.

C. **Cycle though variations** in <a href="#configs">
   several configurations</a> during a single manual run initiation.
   This takes functionality beyond merely testing to engineering.

The objective here is to **reduce the amount of manual effort** (and human errors) to conduct tests.

D. **Centralizing data** from various views of system behavior under stress (or not) 
   can be analyzed together will provide the basis for identifying trends and other insights
   using both manual and "machine learning" techniques.

E. Measure how much time it takes to execute various aspects of JavaScript and other work within various browsers.
   This bar chart shows the difference in response time on different browsers (Chrome vs. Firefox) vs. JMeter.

   TODO: Add Microsoft IE and Edge.

JMeter under-reports the total response times experienced by real users because it focuses on the 
**transfer of files** between client and server.


<a name="TypesOfTest">
### Create scripts to impose load using network emulation vs. UI control</a>
There are several ways automation scripts can pretend to be internet browsers and mobile devices:

<a name="FuncTestScript"></a>
  a). By **controlling the UI** of browsers and native apps,
     pretending to be someone typing and moving the mouse around the screen
    (Selenium, Appium, QTP/UFT, TruClient, are in this category).
    
    These make use of passwords unique to each user
    or two-factor authentication (2FA) tokens which users type into UI dialogs.

<a name="NetworkEmulationTestScript"></a>
  b). By **emulating the network traffic** between client and server
    (BadBoy to capture traffic, JMeter, LoadRunner C-scripts, etc. are in this category).
    
      Such interfaces authenticate using OAuth2 hand-shaking which involves one-way signing or
      OAuth1 which involves mutual exchange of public keys.

   Network traffic emulation scripts can call **API (Application Programming Interfaces)**
   which "headless" programs communicate with each other (with no UI for human users).

These two different types of scripting efforts may
use different programming languages and different tools,
and thus by different people in different groups that don't necessarily talk with each other.

It can be time-consuming to create traffic emulation scripts due to the need to "sniff" traffic
in order to convert observed patterns to script code.

Traffic emulation scripts focus on **file transfer time**,
and cannot report time for JavaScript client-rendering,
which grows more over time as more work is being done client-side.

Codification of API calls into standard patterns makes it now possible to 
**generate test script code**.

## Table of Capabilities and Components </a>
The capabilities of our approach is described below in one sentence (with associated components):

| Capabilities | Components |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| On a sample web server app cloned for test use | app server |
| instantiated with a specific variation of experimental tuning configurations, | <a href="#configs">configs</a> |
| artificial loads are imposed by running | JMeter Controllers |
| virtual user scripts taking the place of humans on real browsers and mobile devices. | JMeter code |
| Specific scenarios of different parameter values | run variations (Taurus) |
| are invoked on a scheduled basis or dynamically | Jenkins |
| when the dev. toolchain is invoked after | dev. toolchain |
| a commit occurs to a specific branch in a git repo. | github |
| During runs: |  |
| log collected and normalized include | Logstash |
| logs of load levels imposed, | run logs |
| log entries issued from within app code and the OS | server Logs |
| plus measurements such as garbage collection | monitor stream |
| obtained by monitoring agents. | agents |
| As for analysis: |  |
| The central repository is indexed into various dimensions | ElastiSearch |
| for visualizations over time and "sliced and diced" for insight. | Kibana |
| The visualizations include static objectives and targets to compare against live data. | ref. data |
| To measure time taken by browsers to execute client application JavaScript: |  |
| browser instances are controlled by | Selenium Web Driver |
| code that manipulate the browser UI like real people do, | Selenium code |
| just as native mobile app test automation code | Appium code |
| are controlled | Appium Driver |
| so that timings are captured | <a href="#BrowserMob">BrowserMob Proxy</a> |
| into files included in analysis. | <a href="#HAR-Files">HAR files</a> |
| All this enables anomalies over performance thresholds to be instantly detected during testing, | levels |
| so that they can be addressed quickly. | alerts |
|  |  |
| To reduce the time traditionally needed to edit and verify | editor |
| we **generate JMeter code**  | j-gen |
| and variations in use of test data to repeatedly call APIs based on what is in | run variations |
| the repository of API specifications | Swagger |
| similar to how app code to call APIs are generated | codegen |
| into source code repositories. | git repo. |
|  |  |
| Generated test code is validated by static source code scanners. | SonarQube |
| in the same or spearate runs than what app source code go through. | dev. toolchain |
| Functional test automation code are generated in a similar way | func. test gen. |

## Existing components</a>
The remainder of this page describes the existing repos made use of by the [approach shown above](#TheVision).


<a name="AUT">
## Sample Application Under Test (AUT)</a>
The ideal sample app would these characteristics:

   0. Be built on code which provides responsive web, native mobile (iOS and Android), plus APIs.
   0. Be built on code which is open sourced (e.g., available on github).
   0. Be built on code which makes use of open sourced libraries and tools (java).
   0. Be built on code accompanied by tutorials on its construction.
   0. Be built on code which contain coding that returns errors when optionally switched on (for validating test code).
   0. Be built with code which exihibits various approaches (pooling, multi-threading) so that performance can be compared.

Apps currently used for tutorials, benchmarking, and pre-sales do not meet all the criteria above.

   * WebTours used in most JMeter tutorials to date (within commerical performance testing software LoadRunner)
     returns errors based on a switch, but its source is not available to the public.

   * PetStore 


<a name="configs"></a>
**Configurations** in servers need to be tuned to obtain the most throughput out of hardware.
Examples of configurations include:

   * Maximum virtual memory allocation
   * Maximum threads
   * Maximum queue length
   * Maximum cache size
   * etc.

<a name="Jenkins"></a>
**Jenkins** 
initiates the various programs listed below on a schedule or when a build is requested.
Selenium and JMeter load generators are slave nodes to Jenkins.

<a name="JMeterScripts"></a>
**JMeter scripts**
ramp up load on servers using less test server resources
than Selenium scripts because they do not maintain a copy of the DOM
of each user.

<a name="CloudEnv"></a>
**Cloud environment.**
Because it usually takes several servers to emulate enough load on an application server under test,
   JMeter is often run within a cloud envrionment such as Amazon.

<a name="configs"></a>
**configs** is the set of configuration settings controlling VM memory and other aspects of the server.

<a name="SeleniumWebDriver"></a>
**Selenium WebDriver**
controls desktop browsers as if humans were tapping on the keyboard and moving the mouse around a browser.

<a name="BrowserMob"></a>
<a name="HAR_Files"></a>
**BrowserMob proxy** at http://bmp.lightbody.net/
captures network traffic into HTTP Archive Report (HAR) files containing measurements of time to load elements on the page. There are several **precise** points in time that can be measured:

<img alt="truperf_selenium_timers" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/300046/9831936/7ae6a9d6-591f-11e5-8f54-29f725c5b6c1.png">

The forum for this is at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/browsermob-proxy

Files are sent to <a href="#LogStash">LogStash</a>.

<a name="AppiumController"></a>
**Appium Controller**
controls native mobile smart phones as if humans were swiping and tapping the screen.

<a name="AppiumCode"></a>
**Appium Code**
controls native mobile smart phones as if humans were swiping and tapping the screen.

<a name="LogStash"></a>
**Logstash** collects data from JMeter, HAR files, web server logs, web app logs, etc. 
into a common location with a common date format.

<a name="ElastiSearch"></a>
**Elasticsearch** combines and indexes logs from several sources.

<a name="Kibana"></a>
**Kibana** displays dashboards from filtered data indexed on several dimensions.

<a name="Swagger"></a>
**Swagger gen**
A complete infrastructure also includes test code generation from a repository of API requirements (Swagger).
